# Exercise 1: Birthday Look-up

# Create a variable called birthdays. Its value should be a dictionary.
# Initialize this variable with the birthdays of 5 people of your choice. For each entry in the dictionary, the key should be the person’s name, and the value should be their birthday. Tip: Use the format "YYYY/MM/DD".
# Print a welcome message for the user. Then tell them: “You can look up the birthdays of the people in the list!”
# Ask the user to give you a person's name and store the answer in a variable.
# Get the birthday of the name provided by the user.
# Print out the birthday with a nicely-formatted message.

# Exercise 2: Birthdays Advanced

# Before asking the user to input a person's name, print out all of the names in the dictionary.
# If the person that the user types is not found in the dictionary, print an error message (“Sorry, we don’t have the birthday information for person's name”).

# Exercise 3: Check the index
# Instructions
# Using this variable

# names = ['Samus', 'Cortana', 'V', 'Link', 'Mario', 'Cortana', 'Samus']
# Ask a user for their name, if their name is in the names list, print out the index of the first occurence of the name.

# Exercise 4: Double Dice
# Create a function that will simulate the rolling of a dice. Call it throw_dice. It should return an integer between 1 and 6.
# Create a function called throw_until_doubles.
# It should keep throwing 2 dice (using your throw_dice function) until they both land on the same number, i.e., until we reach doubles.
# For example: (1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 5) → then stop throwing, because doubles were reached.
# This function should return the number of times it threw the dice in total. In the example above, it should return 3.
# Create a main function. It should throw doubles 100 times (i.e., call your throw_until_doubles function 100 times), and store the results of those function calls (in other words, how many throws it took until doubles were thrown, each time) in a collection. (What kind of collection? Read below to understand what we will need the data for, and this should help you decide which data structure to use).
# After the 100 doubles are thrown, print out a message telling the user how many throws it took in total to reach 100 doubles.
# Also print out a message telling the user the average amount of throws it took to reach doubles. Round this off to 2 decimal places.
# For example:

# If the results of the throws were as follows (your code would do 100 doubles, not just 3):

# (1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 5)
# (3, 3)
# (2, 4), (1, 2), (3, 4), (2, 2)
# Then my output would show something like this:

# Total throws: 8
# Average throws to reach doubles: 2.67.
