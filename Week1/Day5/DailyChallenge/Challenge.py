# Challenge 1 : Sorting


# Instructions
# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Use List Comprehension
# Example:

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: without,hello,bag,world
# Then, the output should be: bag,hello,without,world

def sort_words(input_string):
    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = input_string.split(',')
    
    # Sort the list of words alphabetically using list comprehension
    sorted_words = sorted([word.strip() for word in words])
    
    # Join the sorted list back into a comma-separated string
    output_string = ','.join(sorted_words)
    
    return output_string

# Challenge 2 : Longest Word
# Instructions
# Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence. If two or more words are found, return the first longest word.
# Characters such as apostrophe, comma, period count as part of the word (e.g. O’Connor is 8 characters long).
# Examples

# longest_word("Margaret's toy is a pretty doll.") ➞ "Margaret's"

# longest_word("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") ➞ "forever."

# longest_word("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") ➞ "Forgetfulness"


def longest_word(sentence):
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Initialize variables to track the longest word and its length
    longest = ""
    max_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Check if the current word's length is greater than the max_length found so far
        if len(word) > max_length:
            longest = word
            max_length = len(word)
    
    return longest
