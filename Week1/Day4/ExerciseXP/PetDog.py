# üåü Exercise 3: Dogs Domesticated
# Goal: Create a PetDog class that inherits from Dog and adds training and tricks.

# Step 1: Import the Dog Class

# In a new Python file, import the Dog class from the previous exercise.

# Step 2: Create the PetDog Class

# Create a class called PetDog that inherits from the Dog class.
# Add a trained attribute to the __init__ method, with a default value of False.
# trained means that the dog is trained to do some tricks.
# Implement a train() method that prints the output of bark() and sets trained to True.
# Implement a play(*args) method that prints ‚Äú all play together‚Äù.
# *args on this method is a list of dog instances.
# Implement a do_a_trick() method that prints a random trick if trained is True.
# Use this list for the ramdom tricks:
# tricks = ["does a barrel roll", "stands on his back legs", "shakes your hand", "plays dead"]
# Choose a rendom index from it each time the method is called.


# Step 3: Test PetDog Methods

# Create instances of the PetDog class and test the train(), play(*args), and do_a_trick() methods.
