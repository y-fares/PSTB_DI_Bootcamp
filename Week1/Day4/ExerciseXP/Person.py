# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4: Family and Person Classes
# Goal:

# Practice working with classes and object interactions by modeling a family and its members.

# Instructions:

# Step 1: Create the Person Class

# Define a Person class with the following attributes:
# first_name
# age
# last_name (string, should be initialized as an empty string)
# Add a method called is_18():
# It should return True if the person is 18 or older, otherwise False.


# Step 2: Create the Family Class

# Define a Family class with:
# A last_name attribute
# A members list that will store Person objects (should be initialized as an empty list)


# Add a method called born(first_name, age):
# It should create a new Person object with the given first name and age.
# It should assign the familyâ€™s last name to the person.
# It should add this new person to the members list.


# Add a method called check_majority(first_name):
# It should search the members list for a person with that first_name.
# If the person exists, call their is_18() method.
# If the person is over 18, print:
# "You are over 18, your parents Jane and John accept that you will go out with your friends"
# Otherwise, print:
# "Sorry, you are not allowed to go out with your friends."


# Add a method called family_presentation():
# It should print the familyâ€™s last name.
# Then, it should print each family memberâ€™s first name and age.


# Expected Behavior:

# Once implemented, your program should allow you to:

# Create a family with a last name.
# Add members to the family using the born() method.
# Use check_majority() to see if someone is allowed to go out.
# Display family information with family_presentation().
# Donâ€™t forget to test your classes by creating an instance of Family, adding members, and calling each method to see the expected output.
