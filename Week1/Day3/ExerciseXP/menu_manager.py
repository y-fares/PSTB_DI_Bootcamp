# Exercise 3 : Restaurant Menu Manager
# Instructions
# The purpose of this exercise is to create a restaurant menu. The code will allow a manager to add and delete dishes.
# Create a python file called menu_manager.py.
# Create a class called MenuManager.
# Create a method __init__ that instantiates an attribute called menu. The menu attributes value will be all the current dishes (list of dictionaries). 
# Each dish will be stored in a dictionary where the keys are name, price, spice level and gluten index (which value is a boolean).
# Here is a list of the dishes currently on the menu:
#     Soup – 10 – B - False
#     Hamburger – 15 - A - True
#     Salad – 18 - A - False
#     French Fries – 5 - C - False
#     Beef bourguignon– 25 - B - True
#     Meaning: For the spice level:
#        • A = not spicy,
#        • B = a little spicy,
#        • C = very spicy
# The dishes provided above should be the value of the menu attribute.
# Create a method called add_item(name, price, spice, gluten). This method will add new dishes to the menu.
# Create a method called update_item(name, price, spice, gluten). This method checks whether a dish is in the menu, if the dish exists then update it. 
# If not notify the manager that the dish is not in the menu.
# Create a method called remove_item(name). This method should check if the dish is in the menu, if the dish exists then delete it and print the updated dictionary. 
# If not notify the manager that the dish is not in the menu.
