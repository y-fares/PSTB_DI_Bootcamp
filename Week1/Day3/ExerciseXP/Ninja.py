# Exercise 1 : Call History
# Instructions
# Create a class called Phone. This class takes a parameter called phone_number. 
# When instantiating an object create an attribute called call_history which value is an empty list.
class Phone:
    def __init__(self, phone_number):
        self.phone_number = phone_number
        self.call_history = []
        self.messages = []
# Add a method called call that takes both self and other_phone (i.e another Phone object) as parameters.
# The method should print a string stating who called who, and add this string to the phoneâ€™s call_history.

    def call(self, other_phone):
        call_record = f"Number {self.phone_number} has called number {other_phone.phone_number}"
        print(call_record)
        self.call_history.append(call_record)
        other_phone.call_history.append(call_record)

# Add a method called show_call_history. This method should print the call_history.

        print("Call History:")

# Add another attribute called messages to your __init__() method which value is an empty list.
    # Added in __init__ function

# Create a method called send_message which is similar to the call method. Each message should be saved 
# as a dictionary with the following keys:
# to : the number of another Phone object
# from : your phone number (also a Phone object)
# content
