suggestions for improvement:
- The provided 'code' is just a list of Python packages. It doesn't implement any part of the agentic RAG application described in the chapter. The instructions require building a Streamlit app (`app.py`) and an agentic RAG pipeline in a notebook (`agentic_rag.ipynb`). This submission doesn't do either.
- The listed packages are necessary but not sufficient to fulfill the requirements. The code should implement the agent, retriever, and Streamlit interface.
